# H-ID

## Description

H-ID is an [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) identity provider and forward authentication gateway.

### Security

This is a hobby project. **There are _ABSOLUTELY NO_ security guarantees!**

### Features

- Sign up (with optional invite-only mode)
- Admin accounts
  - user management (invite/view/delete registered users)
- Sign in
  - Email/password authentication
  - 2FA with TOTP and recovery codes
  - Passkeys
  - Forgot password
- Account settings
  - Set/update profile picture
  - Change name/email
- OAuth2 client management
  - every user can register/manage their own clients
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect
  - Authorization Code Flow
  - Available scopes: `openid`, `profile`, `email`
  - Consent dialog (remembered per user-client combination)
- Auth gateway
  - Assign groups to users
  - Allow access per (sub)domain for users/groups
- Interface
  - Mobile & desktop layout
  - Automatic light/dark mode

## Installation (Linux with docker-compose)

Create a `h-id` directory and execute these commands in it:
```sh
mkdir ./data
mkdir ./profile-pictures
touch docker-compose.yml
```
Paste the following content into `docker-compose.yml` and change the environment variables to your desired values:
```yml
services:
  h-id:
    image: ghcr.io/juho05/h-id
    restart: unless-stopped
    user: 1000:1000                     # change to your uid:gid combination
    environment:
      - BASE_URL=https://id.example.com # the URL where you plan to host H-ID
      - BEHIND_PROXY=true               # you should always host H-ID behind a reverse proxy
      - INVITE_ONLY=false               # set to true if you want to disable user sign-up without invitation
      - EMAIL_HOST=<smtp-host>          # SMTP host, e.g. smtp.gmail.com:587
      - EMAIL_USERNAME=<smtp-username>  # SMTP username, e.g. example@gmail.com
      - EMAIL_PASSWORD=<password>       # SMTP password (use an app password if 2FA is activated on your email account)
      - HCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=<site-key>    # leave blank to disable CAPTCHAs
      - HCAPTCHA_SECRET=<secret>        # leave blank to disable CAPTCHAs
      - SESSION_LIFETIME=24h            # lifetime of user sessions, e.g. 8h15m,96h,15m,86400s (I recommend short durations when H-ID is not used as an auth gateway)
      - SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT=4h         # time after which the user is signed out without activity, e.g. 8h15m,96h,15m,86400s (I recommend short durations when H-ID is not used as an auth gateway)
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./profile-pictures:/profile_pictures
  caddy:
    image: caddy:2
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./caddy/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - ./caddy/data:/data
      - ./caddy/config:/config
```

To configure the reverse proxy [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) create a new directory `caddy` in `h-id` and create a file named `Caddyfile` in it with the following content (change `id.example.com` to your domain):
```caddyfile
id.example.com {
  reverse_proxy h-id:8080
}
```

You should now be able to start H-ID by executing the following command in the `h-id` directory:
```sh
docker compose up -d
```

H-ID will be accessible (if you can access port 443 on your server and your domain is properly linked) at `https://<your-domain>`.

You can promote a user to be an administrator with:
```sh
docker compose exec h-id /h-id-cli set-admin user@example.com true # you can also use the user ID instead of the email address
```
This will make the `/admin` endpoint accessible to that user.

To invite a user from the CLI (useful if `INVITE_ONLY` is set before a user was created) execute:
```sh
docker compose exec h-id /h-id-cli invite user@example.com
```

### Auth gateway configuration

To use H-ID as an auth gateway in front of another service make these changes to `docker-compose.yml`:
```yml
services:
  # ...
  h-id:
    # ...
    environment:
      # ...
      - AUTH_GATEWAY_CONFIG=/gateway.json
      - AUTH_GATEWAY_DOMAIN=example.com   # all of your services (including H-ID) must be hosted under this domain/a subdomain
    volumes:
      # ...
      - ./gateway.json:/gateway.json:ro
```

Additionally, it's recommended to use Postgres as the database backend to prevent locking errors.

Access rules can be configured in `./gateway.json`, e.g.:
```json
{
  "users": {
    "user1": {
      "id": "<user_id>",
      "groups": ["group1"]
    },
    "user2": {
      "id": "<user_id>",
      "groups": ["group1"]
    }
  },
  "domains": {
    "test.example.com": {
      "groups": ["group1"]
    },
    "*.example.com": {
      "users": ["user1"]
    }
  }
}
```

Group/user names can be freely chosen. User IDs must match the ID of the user in H-ID.

Domain names can either be fully qualified or use a `*` as a wildcard to match all subdomains (and sub-subdomains):
```yaml
example.com      # valid
test.example.com # valid
*.example.com    # valid (matches foo.example.com, bar.example.com, foo.bar.example.com, â€¦)

*.*.example.com  # invalid
```

Example configuration to protect a service hosted with Caddy with H-ID:
```caddyfile
my-service.example.com {
  forward_auth h-id:8080 {
    uri /gateway/verify
    copy_headers Remote-User
  }
  reverse_proxy my-service:80
}
```

*Make sure that caddy, my-service and h-id are all on the same Docker network.*

## How to update

Execute the following commands in the `h-id` directory:

docker compose pull h-id caddy
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

## How to backup

Simply stop the service with `docker compose down`, back up the `h-id` directory with your favorite backup tool and start H-ID again with `docker compose up -d`.
